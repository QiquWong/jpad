The method has been implemented because its results were in good agreement with the experimental results. &#10;&#10;The lifting surfaces are divided in several rectangular horse-shoe vortices along the span; one horseshoe vortex along the chord is used, that is, the midpoints of the vortices are placed only at points along the quarter-chord lines. An equal number of control points are located along the three-quarter-chord lines. &#10;The velocity from the total vortex system is equated to the component of free-stream velocity normal to the lifting surface chord at each control point. Application of this tangent-flow boundary condition for a symmetrical loading provides a set of N simultaneous equations in the N unknown circulation strengths. &#10;Solution of this set of equations provides the loading distributions over the lifting surfaces. &#10;Mach number effect is introduced through a Prandtl-Glauert correction.&#10;The Nasa-Blackwell method is an inviscid method so in order to evaluate the maximul lift coeffient it has been coupled with the stall path metod. &#10;" wrapText="true" VBox.vgrow="ALWAYS">

To do this, click on &quot;Input&quot;. Anyway, at this stage it is not possible to click on &quot;Analysis&quot; button. &#10;It is possible both to read an external .xml file and to write all data using this tool. To read an external file, click the button &quot;from file&quot; and the text field to define the input file will be enabled. Search for the input file with the required tags by clicking on the button with dots. Click on &quot;Load&quot; button and all data will appear on the related field. It is possible to change some data. Please read the instructions in the xml example file (&quot;WingAnalysis_inputTemplate.xml&quot;). When all data are right, click on &quot;Confirm Data&quot; button. At this stage the wing top view will appeared on the right side of the window and all the data will be setted. &#10;It is possible to change only some data, after charging an input file. It is important to click on the &quot;Confirm Data&quot; button after every data change. It is also possible to use different units in the same input file. After defining the number of sections, remember to click “ok” button. &#10;&#10;After defining and confirming all data, it is possible to click on “Go to Analyses” button to return to the previous scene. A green line around input button means that the input file is correctly written. At this stage it is possible to click again on the Input button if you need to change some data.&#10;&#10;Click on the “Analysis” button to access to analyses. This stage is divided in tabs one for each analysis. The analyses are enabled by default. If you don’t want to perform an analysis, click on “disable this analysis”, otherwise it is necessary to write the input data.&#10;It is possible to choose the way to give the alpha input values: as a linearly spaced vector, or with a certain number of angles. This is possible to be chosen clicking on the buttons related to “Alphas input mode”. It is possible to perform more load analyses changing the input angles of attack and click again on the button “Perform Load Distribution Analysis”. All the numerical results will be written in the text area at the bottom of the windows, and only the last analysis will be saved, if request.&#10;&#10;" wrapText="true" VBox.vgrow="ALWAYS">
