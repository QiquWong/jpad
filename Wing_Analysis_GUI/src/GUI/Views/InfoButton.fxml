The method has been implemented because its results&#10; were in good agreement with the experimental results. &#10;&#10;The lifting surfaces are divided in several rectangular horse-shoe vortices along the span; one horseshoe&#10; vortex along the chord is used, that is, the midpoints of the vortices are placed only at points along the &#10;quarter-chord lines. An equal number of control points are located along the three-quarter-chord lines. &#10;The velocity from the total vortex system is equated to the component of free-stream velocity normal to&#10; the lifting surface chord at each control point. Application of this tangent-flow boundary condition for a &#10;symmetrical loading provides a set of N simultaneous equations in the N unknown circulation strengths. &#10;Solution of this set of equations provides the loading distributions over the lifting surfaces. &#10;Mach number effect is introduced through a Prandtl-Glauert correction.&#10;&#10;The Nasa-Blackwell method is an inviscid method so in order to evaluate the maximul lift coeffient it has &#10;been coupled with the stall path metod. &#10;&#10;&#10;">
