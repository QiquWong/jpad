C     Version 4.46 11/28/01


Make the plotlib under Unix by:

  Before anything is compiled, the config.make file needs to be changed
  to reflect your compiler and library options.  Two versions of config.make
  are supplied (config.make.SP and config.make.DP) which contain options for 
  making single and double precision versions of the plotlib.  Note that there
  are sample declarations several architectures in the Makefile, you may need 
  to be comment or uncomment options for your machine. Note that under Unix 
  you can simply make a symbolic link to one of these config.make.xx files to 
  define config.make using:

    % ln -s config.make.SP config.make

  or simply 

    % cp config.make.SP config.make

  Then do the make using 

    % make 



Make the plotlib under Windoze:

  You need Visual C and either the Compaq Visual Fortran compiler or the Intel
  Fortran compiler.  You should check the options in Makefile.NT to ensure that
  they match your system.  The supplied files match the Intel Fortran compiler.

  Compile and link with command in DOS window: 
  C:\Xfoil\plotlib: cd win32
  C:\Xfoil\plotlib\win32: nmake /f Makefile.NT

  This places all the .obj files in the win32 directory and copies libPltxx.lib
  to the parent plotlib directory.

  Alternatively you could load all the files into a Visual Studio project and
  create the library that way.


To create plot library libPlt.a (single precision) you can normally just type:
  % make
  provided the file config.make matches your machine. The supplied config.make
  matches the config.make.SP single precision options file.

To create plot library libPltDP.a (double precision version):
  Link or copy file config.make.DP to config.make and check that the options
  match your machine.  Then type:
  % make

If you don't have a file config.make.DP your alternative is to to this:
  go into the config.make and uncomment the line 
#PLTLIB = libPltDP.a
  set the DP flag for your compiler (uncomment appropriate line) and then:
  % make


To install plot library libPlt.a:
  check the config.make and Makefile for proper install options and 
  destination for your system
  % make install


To create test, example and color selection programs (all optional):
  % make test

OR, go into the examples directory and do a:
  % make

if you want to put the examples in the parent library directory as well:
  % make test

To create the test and examples under Windoze:
  C:\Xfoil\plotlib: cd examples
  C:\Xfoil\plotlib\examples: nmake /f Makefile.NT



To set black-on-white video, define Unix variable as follows:
  % setenv XPLOT11_BACKGROUND white


To restore white-on-black video:
  % unsetenv XPLOT11_BACKGROUND
