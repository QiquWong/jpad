This Readme file pertains to the Absoft Linux f77 compiler, version 5.x, this 
stuff has not been checked for later versions...

Various compilers support intrinsics for RSHIFT, LSHIFT and AND().  Absoft
is among those that do not have these supported (also HPUX f77 at last check).

I added a file (util-ops.f) that needs to be included for the Absoft f77 environment.  This file contains functions for bit shifts RSHIFT,LSHIFT and 
arithmetic AND(I1,I2) for fortrans that lack these intrinsics. 

See the Makefile where this is one of the commented out options.

Note that a number of compile switches need to be set when using the Absoft
f77 compiler.  See the Makefile for these. 


Absoft Linux f77 flags that I use... 

DP = -N113 (only for making a double precision version of the library)
FFLAGS  = -s -f -O -B100 -B108 -N3 -N90 $(DP)

-s static
-f force to lower case
-O optimize
-B100 Pentium Pro flag (use -B101 for general Pentium compatibility)
-B108 append single underscore to names
-N3 explicitly opened unformatted files contain record information
-N90 pass character args same as g77 and f2c
-N113 lame version of -r8 flag to promote singles into doubles 

Note that you will need to link with the libU77 library if you use some
of the UNIX fortran-isms like GETARG.  This is supplied by Absoft but is not
in their default link libs.  You need to add this library to a link statement
something like this:

f77 -o foobar foobar.o -lU77
