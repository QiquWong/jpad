This directory contains random, outdated but potentially useful info or 
Makefiles. 

You may need to read through these and change things substantially to get them working on your machine.  They may be of some help.

makesplitlib  Script for making a libPlt.a with each routine in a separate
              object file. This may be necessary if you want to change
              particular subroutines within the plotlib with your own 
              versions and get them to link.  The current library archives
              all the routines within a source file into one linkable entity.

Makefile.linux.shared  This makefile was used to make a shared object (ELF)
                       library for Linux.  If you know what this means I don't
                       really need to tell you more.

Readme.absoft  Discusses the quirks of the Absoft Fortran compiler(s).  The 
               Linux versions were the ones specifically addressed here.
