The \gls{JPAD} library implements, indeed, a lot of functionalities and is almost complete in terms of analysis types. The present version of the library can perform a complete aircraft analysis in few seconds, including weights, balance, aerodynamics, costs and performance analysis; but some work has still to be done. 

\bigskip
\noindent
In particular the definition of a comprehensive and user-friendly input file structure is in development, following the guideline described in paragraph \ref{par:InputFile}; moreover the library doesn't have yet a working module for the optimization process (see paragraph \ref{par:Optimization}) which will be subject of future developments once all main features will be completed (for example the lateral-directional stability module or the landing distance calculation). Last, but not least, is the creation of a smart and pleasant \gls{acr:GUI} using as baseline the one described in paragraph \ref{par:GUI}; this feature has not to be underestimated since can provide significantly benefits to the user like a simply way of managing and view results as well as managing many aircrafts, or different versions of the same one, at the same time making easy to compare their characteristics.
