Any body in motion in a fluid presents a result of force acting on it, which can be decomposed in two components:
\begin{itemize}
\item A {\bfseries Lift} acting normal to the Velocity direction and is positive upward.
\item A {\bfseries Drag} acting in the opposite direction to the airspeed vector.
\end{itemize}
The lifting surfaces of an airplane are designed to generate lift exceeding their drag, in order to obtain a positive efficiency.
