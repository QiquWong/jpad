# JPAD, a Java Program toolchain for Aircraft Designers

JPAD is a Java software library, a toolbox providing a set of classes and utility functions that you can use to build software systems. Some features of JPAD are dependent on some native libraries that are provided only for the Windows 64-bit platform. These libraries are open source and users of other platforms, such as Linux or Mac OSX, must build their own version.

The typical user of JPAD is the aircraft designer, one who is interested in aerodynamic or performance predictions and in parametric studies. The principal focus of the library is the overall aircraft model, conceived as a set of interconnected and parametrized submodels: the wing and its variants (horizontal tail, vertical tail, canard), the fuselage, nacelles, the propulsion system.

## JPAD Main modules

- `JPADConfigs`
- `JPADCore_v2`
- `JPADCAD`

The modules `JPADSandbox_v2` and `JPADCADSandbox` are used for testing and development of new features.

# Caveat

JPAD is under heavy development and is about to reach a beta state. The codebase is provided here because we believe in the open source philosophy.
