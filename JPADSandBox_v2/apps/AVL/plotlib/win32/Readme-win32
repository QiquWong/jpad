Make the plotlib under Windoze:

  You need Visual C and either the Compaq Visual Fortran compiler or the Intel
  Fortran compiler.  You should check the options in Makefile.NT to ensure that
  they match your system.  The supplied files match the Intel Fortran compiler.

  Compile and link with command in DOS window: 
  C:\Xfoil\plotlib: cd win32
  C:\Xfoil\plotlib\win32: nmake /f Makefile.NT

  This places all the .obj files in the win32 directory and copies libPltxx.lib
  to the parent plotlib directory.

  Alternatively you could load all the files into a Visual Studio project and
  create the library that way.
