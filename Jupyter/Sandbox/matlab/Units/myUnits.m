%% Do not use phsical units at all and just define all base units as 1. 
% % (Use when calls to DimVar methods are significanly slowing execution.)

% [u.m, u.kg, u.s, u.A, u.K, u.mol, u.cd, u.USD] = deal(1);

% While writing code using physical units makes code faster to develop, easier
% to read, and easier to debug, it may slow the code down due to all the calls
% to the DimVar methods. One good solution to working with the class is to
% develop the code using the class, but _after_ it's all tested and debugged,
% use this line in myUnits.m to do all math with normal variables.
